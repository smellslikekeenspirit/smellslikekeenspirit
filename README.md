#### A very condensed bio :cherry_blossom:
---
Allowing concrete achievements - academic or otherwise - to speak for my prowess is quite uncomfortable, but it is the most convenient metric to hand someone who has no other data. 

:tulip: I am an Honors student, which is to say that I am in the top 1% of class in terms of academics and extracurricular activities. To continue to be a part of this program, I have to take advanced classes, wipe off a mixture of tears and sweat off of myself to maintain a high GPA and display intense community involvement. 

:maple_leaf: In the summer, I'll be at Spotify on one of their Personalization teams. Last semester I worked at HubSpot as a software engineering intern on an internal team that develops data analysis tools. 

:sunflower: Currently, I am doing research with National Technical Institute for the Deaf on a project that seeks to identify key prospective features that will help the deaf communicate better with the hearing. 

:hibiscus: I take great interest in reading and writing, both prose and poetry; I am on the editorial team for Signatures, my college‚Äôs award-winning yearly magazine. Besides that, you can find my writing sprinkled around the virtual realm. [Here's](https://medium.com/@priontinasir) one of the places I speak of. 

:rose: I am also a trained Indian classical singer and I play the harmonium, esraj and tanpura - I wish I could replace one of these with the guitar :c

#### Software-specific bit :computer:

I have learned to appreciate readable, elegant code over my time as a baby developer. I mean, I promise I don't like leaving code unattended. I'd rather make elaborate flower garlands for each function in the form of documentation. But I often don't have the time to do so...

I am picky about my variable names, they ought to fit into context and be coherent in my code. Unless it's an experimental project. Then I'd use x and y until I am certain the program even works. 

And I find recursive solutions beautiful.
