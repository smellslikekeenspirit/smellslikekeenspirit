#### A very condensed bio :cherry_blossom:
---
Allowing concrete achievements - academic or otherwise - to speak for me is quite uncomfortable, but they are the most convenient metric to hand someone who has no other data. 

:maple_leaf: In the fall, I was at Spotify on one of their Personalization teams. In the summer, I was at Microsoft working across the stack on a new product. Last year I worked at HubSpot as a software engineering intern on a team that develops data analysis tools. 

:sunflower: Currently, I am doing research with National Technical Institute for the Deaf on an NSF-funded project that seeks to build a better metric than the word-error rate for the evaluation of automatic captioning systems. 

:hibiscus: I take great interest in reading and writing, both prose and poetry; I am on the editorial team for [Signatures](http://www.signaturesmag.com/) among other writing/writing-adjacent gigs.

:rose: I am also a trained Indian classical singer and I play the harmonium, esraj and tanpura - I wish I could replace one of these with the guitar :c

💮 Also, here are [some hackathon projects](https://devpost.com/smellslikekeenspirit).

#### Coding-specific bit :computer:

I have learned to appreciate readable, elegant code over my time as a baby developer. I mean, I promise I don't like leaving code unattended. I'd rather make elaborate flower garlands for each function in the form of documentation. But I often don't have the time to do so...

I am picky about my variable names, they ought to fit into context and be coherent in my code. Unless it's an experimental project. Then I'd use x and y until I am certain the program even works. 

And I find recursive solutions beautiful.
