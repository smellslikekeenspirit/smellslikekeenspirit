Allowing concrete achievements - academic or otherwise - to speak for my prowess is quite uncomfortable, but it is the only heuristically efficient metric to hand someone who has no other data. I am an Honors scholar at my university, which is to say that I am in the top 1% of students in terms of academics and extracurricular activities. To continue to be a part of this program, I have to take advanced classes, wipe off a mixture of tears and sweat off of myself to maintain a high GPA and display intense community involvement. I take relentless interest in reading and writing, both prose and poetry; I am a features writer for the Reporter, my collegeâ€™s monthly magazine. Besides that, you can find my writing sprinkled around the virtual realm. [Here's](https://medium.com/@priontidipitanasir) one of the places I speak of. I am also a trained Indian classical singer and I play the harmonium, esraj and tanpura - I wish I could replace one of these with the guitar.

#### Software-specific bit :computer:
I have learned to appreciate readable, elegant code over my time as a baby developer. I don't like leaving code unattended. I'd rather make elaborate flower garlands for each function in the form of documentation. But I often don't have the time to do so...

I am picky about my variable names, they ought to fit into context and be coherent in my code. Unless it's an experimental project. Then I'd use x and y until I am certain the program even works. 

And I find recursive solutions beautiful. 

#### ðŸ”­ Currently working on :hammer:
At the end of last semester, I landed a research position for an NSF project, undertaken by MITRE and the National Technical Institute for the Deaf. The goal is to locate a workable word-error rate that is convenient enough for the deaf and hard-of-hearing, and consequently to develop an ASR with that capability, as well as with additional features. This semester, I helped in producing control data against which we can measure which model best approximates a given automatic captioning systemâ€™s accuracy. The main task lined up for the next semester is contributing to the codebase for a model that approximates the accuracy of ASRs.
